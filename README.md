Most promising concept for a game we've had yet, and I still have an interest in continuing it. With my free time this school year I'll begin development, and I guess I'll have to learn pixel art.

So many amazing gameplay ideas were created for this game, and if given enough time and thought, it could probably turn out to be pretty great.

I've gained an insane amount of game dev/programming skills in the last year, so I think this may be feasible. It'll have actual viewports and cameras and physics!

Be warned: That code manages to be even WORSE than the code in this repo.
